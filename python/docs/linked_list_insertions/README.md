## Whiteboard Process

![White Board](linked-list-insertion.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
used google to understand appending a linked list

used pre built methods inpython to append at the end as well as insert them before and after

time O(n) its modifying to the tail so it needs to traverse to the end so its equal to the amount it takes to get there if it was appending tot he front it would be one

space is   O(1) its modifying to the tail with one new node so the time requirement is constant of 1
or in the case of before or after it is still 1
