## Hash Tables or Hash Maps

Hash tables are an incredibly efficient way of collecting data that has been stored, This is the manner in which accessing a dictionary in python is done so its very interesting and very important to learn because so much of python is used for optimizing programs and scripts and we are always talking about Bif O so we should know a good way to improve it 

## Approach & Efficiency
Using the lecture Found on friday We built functions according to the structure and teachings of adam there a are for differnet ways to access the inforamtion in the table 

1. get
2. hash
3. has
4. Keys

I am still having problems passing the tests some of my inforamtion is being returned in reverese order and I need to continue working on that bug
