# Challenge Summary
* Write a function called fizz buzz tree
* Arguments: k-ary tree
* Return: new k-ary tree
* Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:

  - If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
  - If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
  - If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
  - If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
